SeeFood and TechCrunch combine your senses to give you the experience of eating food while having zero calories! (If you don't bite too hard)

### SeeFood

SeeFood gives you the visual experience of eating food through virtual reality. You can see and touch your food virtually and move it to your mouth to eat it.

### TechCrunch

TechCrunch gives you the gustatory experience of eating food through thermal and electrical stimulation of the tongue. 
By heating or cooling your tongue or by providing weak high frequency currents at the tip of your tongue, you will be able to taste your food.
